# HVBRD (v2 with web sockets)

Interactive hoverboard experiment using a mobile phone and web sockets.

**The original version of this project was built using a Daydream controller.
To make it accessible to more people, I've changed it to use a mobile phone to connect to the browser via web sockets.**
